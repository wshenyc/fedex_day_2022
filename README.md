# NYC Housing Court Filings

This is an interactive map showing NYC Housing Court filings from Jan 2016-Jan 2022. Click [here](https://wshenyc.github.io/fedex_day_2022/) to access the map.

## Data Sources

I made use of Housing Data Coalition's [nycdb](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb/wiki/Dataset:-OCA-Housing-Court-Records). Their "dataset comes from the Customized Statewide Landlord and Tenant Data Extract (without personally identifying information) compiled from information collected in the New York State Office of Court Administrationâ€™s (OCA) Universal Case Management System for Local Civil Courts (UCMS-LC)." NYC zip code shape files were pulled from [Beta NYC](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-zip-code-tabulation-areas/resource/6df127b1-6d04-4bb7-b983-07402a2c3f90).

## Usage

Users can click on a zipcode to see the following information: 1) how many housing court cases were filed Jan 1, 2016 to Jan 16, 2022; 2) what percentage of respondents had legal representation; 3) what percentage of respondents appeared in court; and 4) how many warrants of eviction were executed. 

The map is also currently styled as a chloropleth map showing how many warrants were executed by zip code.

## Why is this important?

It's important to identify which potential areas in NYC people aren't being connected to the resources or information they may need to have an eviction dismissed.
