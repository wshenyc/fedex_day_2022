# NYC Housing Court Filings

This is an interactive map showing NYC Housing Court filings from Jan 2016-Jan 2022. Click [here](https://wshenyc.github.io/fedex_day_2022/) to access the map.

## Data Sources

I made use of Housing Data Coalition's [nycdb](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb/wiki/Dataset:-OCA-Housing-Court-Records). Their "dataset comes from the Customized Statewide Landlord and Tenant Data Extract (without personally identifying information) compiled from information collected in the New York State Office of Court Administration’s (OCA) Universal Case Management System for Local Civil Courts (UCMS-LC)." NYC zip code shape files were pulled from [Beta NYC](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-zip-code-tabulation-areas/resource/6df127b1-6d04-4bb7-b983-07402a2c3f90).

## Usage

Users can hover over a zipcode to see the following information: 1) how many housing court cases were filed Jan 1, 2016 to Jan 16, 2022; 2) what percentage of respondents had legal representation; 3) what percentage of respondents appeared in court; and 4) how many warrants of eviction were executed.

## Why is this important?

It's important to identify which potential areas in NYC people aren't being connected to the resources or information they may need to have an eviction dismissed.
